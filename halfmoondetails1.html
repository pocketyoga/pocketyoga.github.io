		<h2><b>Half Moon Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Half Moon Pose is a standing yoga posture that will challenge your leg muscles and your ability to balance. It can also be a fun pose to transition into from Extended Triangle (Utthita Trikonasana)! The two poses are similar in their full-body extension; Half Moon is like a balancing variation of Triangle.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Do not practice Half Moon Pose if you have low blood pressure or are currently experiencing headaches, insomnia, or diarrhea. Those with neck injuries should not turn their heads to face the top hand (in Step 7 of the Instructions, below), but should continue looking straight ahead. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin by standing at the top of your mat. Turn to the left and step your feet wide apart. Extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder-height. Your feet should be as far apart as your wrists. Rotate your right (front) foot 90 degrees, so your front foot’s toes point to the top of the mat. Turn your left foot’s toes slightly in. Align your front heel with the arch of your back foot.
<br>Reach through your right hand in the same direction that your right foot is pointed. Shift your left hip back, and then fold sideways at the hip. Rest your right hand on your outer right shin or ankle. If you are more flexible, place your fingertips on the floor. You can also place your hand on a yoga block.
<br>Align your shoulders so your left shoulder is directly above your right shoulder. Gently turn your head to gaze at your left thumb. This is Extended Triangle Pose (Utthita Trikonasana).
<br>Bring your left hand to rest on your left hip. Turn your head to look at the floor. Then, bend your right knee and step your left foot 6-12 inches closer to your right foot. Place your right hand’s fingertips on the floor in front of your right foot.
<br>Press firmly into your right hand and foot. Straighten your right leg while simultaneously lifting your left leg. Work toward brining your left leg parallel to the floor, or even higher than your hips.
<br>Reach actively through your left heel. Do not lock your right leg’s knee. Keep your right foot’s toes and kneecap facing in the direction of your head.
<br>Stack your top hip directly over your bottom hip, and open your torso to the left. Then extend your left arm and point your fingertips directly toward the sky. If you can balance comfortably there, turn your head and gaze at your left thumb.
<br>Draw your shoulderblades firmly into your back. Lengthen your tailbone toward your left heel.
<br>Hold for up to one minute. To release, lower your left leg as you exhale. Return to Extended Triangle Pose. Inhale and press firmly through your left heel as you lift your torso. Lower your arms. Turn to the left, reversing the position of your feet, and repeat for the same length of time on the opposite side.
