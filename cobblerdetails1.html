    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p>
    Avoid this pose if you have a groin or knee injury and experience any pain while performing it.
    Be sure that you don't force the position and you enter into it and out of it smoothly. Don't move your knees up and down to try to deepen the stretch.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together as you let your knees fall out to either side.
<br>Draw your feet in as close to your body as is comfortable. Back off if you feel any pain in your knees.
<br>Press the outer edges of your feet together strongly. The feet may begin to open like a book. You can encourage this with your hands or hold onto your big toes in a yogi toe lock. 
<br>Sit up tall with a long spine while keeping your shoulder blades on your back and your shoulders moving away from your ears.
