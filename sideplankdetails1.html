		<h2><b>Side Plank Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>A powerful arm balance, Side Plank Pose — Vasisthasana (VAH-shees-THAH-suh-nuh) — challenges your ability to stay calm and focused. Its name comes from the Sanskrit word “Vasistha,” which literally means, “most excellent” or “best.” The word implies the spiritual contentment that those on the yogic path can attain. Many great yoga sages have been named “Vasistha.” Thus, the pose is also sometimes referred to as “Sage Pose.”</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Please avoid this pose if you have an arm, shoulder, or wrist injury. Vasisthasana requires a lot of strength to be performed correctly. It is very easy to injure yourself if you move into it too soon. If you do not yet have the strength to do the pose in proper alignment, practice a modified version until you can support your full body weight correctly. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin in Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana). Lower your hips and shift your weight forward to come into Plank Pose (the top of a push-up): Palms flat, body extended, with your legs reaching through your heels.
<br>Step your feet together and press your weight down through your right hand and forearm. Then, roll your body to the right, balancing on the outer edge of your right foot. Stack your left foot on top of your right foot and keep your legs straight.
<br>Beginners can lower their right knee and shin to the mat, keeping their hips lifted while building strength in the arms and torso.
<br>Extend your left arm to the sky, reaching through your fingertips as you lift your hips and firm the triceps of both arms. Feel the muscles across your shoulder blades flex. Firm your thighs, and press through your heels into the floor.
<br>Bring your body into one straight line. Gaze at your top thumb. Press down through your bottom index finger.
<br>Hold for up to 30 seconds. Exhale as you slowly return to Plank Pose, then into Downward-Facing Dog. Repeat on the opposite side. After both sides, rest in Child’s Pose (Balasana).
