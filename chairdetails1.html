		<h2><b>Chair Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Chair Pose — Utkatasana (OOT-kuh-TAHS-uh-nuh) — is a standing yoga posture that tones the entire body, particularly the thighs! Utkatasana is also sometimes referred to as “Awkward Chair Pose,” “Thunderbolt Pose,” or “Powerful Pose.” Its Sanskrit name comes from the words “utkata” (meaning “powerful” or “fierce”) and “asana” (meaning “pose”). It can be a fierce pose for your thighs and it gets your heart pumping quickly.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Do not practice Utkatasana if you are currently experiencing headaches, low blood pressure, or insomnia. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana). Stand with your feet together, with your big toes touching. Beginners can stand with their feet hip-distance apart.
<br>Inhale and raise your arms above your head, perpendicular to the floor.
<br>Exhale as you bend your knees, bringing your thighs as parallel to the floor as they can get. Your knees will project out slightly over your feet and your torso will form approximately a right angle over your thighs.
<br>Draw your shoulder blades into your upper back ribs as you reach your elbows back towards your ears. Do not puff your ribcage forward. Draw your tailbone down to the floor, keeping your lower back long.
<br>Bring your hips down even lower and lift through your heart. There will be a slight bend in your upper back.
<br>Shift your weight into your heels. Enough weight — approximately 80 percent — should be transferred to your heels so that you could lift your toes off the mat if you wanted to.
<br>Keep your breath smooth, even, and deep. If your breath becomes shallow or strained, back off a bit in the pose until breathing becomes easier.
<br>Spread your shoulder blades apart. Spin your pinky fingers toward each other so your palms face each other, rotating your arms outward through your thumbs.
<br>Gaze directly forward. For a deeper pose, tilt your head slightly and gaze at a point between your hands.
<br>Hold for up to one minute. Then, inhale as you straighten your legs, lifting through your arms. Exhale and release back to Tadasana. Those practicing Sun Salutations should move directly from Utkatasana into Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana).
