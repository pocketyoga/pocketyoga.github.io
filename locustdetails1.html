		<h2><b>Locust Pose in Yoga<b></h2>
<p>Locust Pose is a backbend that can prep the beginner for deeper backbends and poses such as Bow, Upward Dog, and Wheel Pose. In a sequence, you might use Cobra or Snake to lead up to Locust Pose, and follow it with Bow or Crocodile. You can also use it after a Sun Salutation to help energize yourself, stretch your spine, and open your chest, which can help you achieve better posture.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Bring your arms down by your sides with your palms facing the floor. Stretch your legs straight out behind you with the tops of your feet on the mat.
<br>Bring your forehead or your chin to the mat in preparation. Roll your shoulders back and down to open your chest.
<br>Inhale and lift your head, chest, and arms up off the floor. Keep your arms straight behind you. Reach through all 10 fingers and turn your hands so that your thumbs are pointing down. Keep sliding your shoulder blades down your back.
<br>Engage your legs so that your knees lift off the floor. At the same time, try not to tighten your butt too much so that your tailbone has somewhere to go as you backbend. Press the tops of your feet strongly into the floor.
<br>Keep your gaze on the floor just in front of you so that your neck stays in a neutral position, not cranking up.
<br>Stay in this pose for three to five breaths. On an exhale, release down to the floor. Turn your head to one side and rest on your cheek.
