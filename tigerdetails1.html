		<h2><b>Tiger Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Tiger Pose simulates the stretch a tiger makes when it wakes up. It is a super delicious spinal lengthener and backbend. Use this posture to stretch out your entire front body, from your ankles all the way through your thighs, abdomen, chest, and up to your throat.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin on your hands and knees in Table Pose (Goasana). Knees are shoulder width apart and parallel below the hips. Place hands flat on the mat, wrists and elbow under the shoulders. The tops of your feet should be flat on the floor. Gaze down towards the floor. Engage your core muscles for stability.
<br>Inhale. As you exhale, bring the right knee towards your forehead. The back is rounded and core muscles contract to keep the leg lifted. Retain the breath.
<br>Inhale, extend and raise the right leg back, bend the knee. Lengthen and arch the spine. Keep the hips level and try to bring toes as close to the head as possible. At the same time, look forward and slightly upward. Again, retain the breath with the lungs full.
<br>Alternate between these two positions following the rhythm of your breath. Inhaling with extension, exhaling with contraction.
<br>Once you have completed the desired number of rounds with the right leg, return to all fours. Take a small break in extended Child’s Pose (Balasana).
<br>Return to ‘all fours’ and repeat on the other side.
