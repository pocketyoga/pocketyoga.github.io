		<h2><b>Half Forward Fold Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Half Standing Forward Fold — Ardha Uttanasana (ARD-uh ooh-tuhn-AHS-uh-nuh) — stretches and rejuvenates the spine and legs. This pose is an essential element of Sun Salutations and helps to prepare the body for deeper yoga poses.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Those with back injuries should practice this pose with their hands resting on the back of a chair or against a wall. Keep the knees slightly bent. If you have a neck injury, keep your head down — do not lift it to gaze forward. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin in Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana), with your hands or fingertips on the floor at the side of each foot. You can also rest your hands on your shins, or press your palms into yoga blocks at the sides of your feet.
<br>Inhale as you raise the front of your torso away from your thighs, straightening your elbows.
<br>Lift your collarbones and sternum away from the floor. Reach the crown of your head forward and your tailbone behind you. You can bend your knees slightly to help straighten the torso and spine.
<br>Press your fingertips or palms into the floor, to help lift and straighten your torso.
<br>Lift your head slightly and gaze forward without compressing the neck. Your torso should be straight. If your back rounds, bend your knees or place your hands higher until your spine is straight.
<br>Engage your quadriceps (the front thigh muscles) and draw them up toward the ceiling. Do not lock your knees; keep them slightly bent.
<br>Bring your weight to the balls of your feet. Keep your hips aligned over your ankles.
<br>Slightly lift and lengthen your torso with each inhalation.
<br>Hold the pose for up to one minute. Exhale as you release into Uttanasana. Repeat 5-10 times. Those practicing Sun Salutations should move directly from Ardha Uttanasana into Low Lunge, Plank, or Chaturanga.
