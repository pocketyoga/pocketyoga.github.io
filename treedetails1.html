		<h2><b>Tree Pose in Yoga<b></h2>
<p>Tree Pose (Vrksansana) is usually the first standing balance pose that is taught to yoga beginners because it's the simplest. Keep your sense of humor about learning to stand on one leg. It's harder than it looks at first and will be different every day. Don't get frustrated if you wobble or even fall over at first.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p>
    If you have balance problems, use caution with this pose and do it near a wall where you can support yourself as needed. This pose is not recommended if you have a knee or hip injury.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Take a moment to feel both your feet root into the floor with your weight distributed equally on all four corners of each foot.
<br>Begin to shift your weight into your right foot, lifting your left foot off the floor. Keep your right leg straight but don't lock the knee.
<br>Bend your left knee and bring the sole of your left foot high onto your inner right thigh. 
<br>Press your foot into your thigh and your thigh back into your foot with equal pressure. This will help you keep both hips squared toward the front so your right hip doesn't jut out.
<br>Focus your gaze (Drishti) on something that doesn't move to help you keep your balance.
<br>Take 5 to 10 breaths, then lower your left foot to the floor and do the other side.
