		<h2><b>Reclining bound angle Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclining Bound Angle Pose) name comes from the Sanskrit words ‘supta’=’reclined’, ‘baddha’= ‘bound’, ‘kona' = ‘angle’ or ‘split’ and ‘asana’=’posture’. This pose comes under the category of restorative yoga poses, where while practicing yoga practitioner is more conscious of the body in order to renew energy and calm the nervous system. Generally this pose concludes a yoga session to end in a beautiful relaxing way to gain control over the body and the mind. The supine position gives rest to the back and the hips and hence this pose is a must as part of every yoga session. Most relaxing yoga poses look easy but they require tremendous effort to bring the mind to focus on the body while the body is relaxed. This only comes through practice.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Come to Savasana, stretching the legs and the entire back completely. Placing the hips and the shoulders on the mat adjust the lower back and take a few breaths watching the expansion of the spine as the inhalation happens.
<br>Bend your legs at the knees, bringing your feet close to each other and place the soles of the feet in Namaste, with heels facing your lower back and toes pointed forward.
<br>With the soles touching each other, press the outer knees close to the floor watching for the stretches at the lower abdomen, inner thighs and at the groin.
<br>With slow breathing work towards the heels by bringing them close to your hips. This will help in widening the knees.
<br>Bring the arms on the floor to rest besides your body with palms facing up and throw all the fingers apart. Make sure the arms are not stretched at shoulder level, but a bit lower close to the hips.
<br>Bring the shoulders completely settled on the floor and bring the chin down to elongate the neck and relax the facial muscles.
<br>Get comfortable with the pose making sure there are not unecessary stretches anywhere.
<br>Begin a slow rhythmic breathing which should also be deep by taking maximum air into the lungs, chest and the abdomen. While inhaling, go with the body upwards and as you exhale sunk the spine deep onto the floor and push the knees towards the floor.
<br>If one is practicing Reclining Bound Angle Pose after a good yoga session, then ensure the muscles are completely relaxed with the breathing and watch for the movement of the spine taking in enough air to exhale slowly and with ease.
<br>If one is practicing Reclining Bound Angle Pose, purely for meditative, restorative or for therapeutic use, then make sure the pose is practiced with full support at the head, knees, shoulders and the lower back with bolsters, blankets and blocks. Using guidance from an experienced teacher would be beneficial.
<br>Remain in this pose for about 24 breaths irrespective of the reason for practice, but one could watch the comfort of the body while remaining in this pose and adjust the duration.
<br>To release, slowly stretch the legs out completely and relax the knees and the ankles and bring the lower back to the floor.
<br>Go back to Savasana and continue relaxing the body and if required on could go back to the practice of Supta Baddha Konasana.
