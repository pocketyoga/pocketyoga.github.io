		<h2><b>Child Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Child's Pose — Balasana (bah-LAHS-uh-nuh) — is a common beginner's yoga pose. It is often used as a resting position in between more difficult poses during a yoga practice. The word "Balasana" comes from the Sanskrit words "bala" (meaning "child") and "asana" (meaning "pose").</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Do not practice Child's Pose if you have a current or recent knee injury. Women who are pregnant should only practice a wide-legged variation of the pose — do not press the belly on top of the thighs.
Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin on your hands and knees. Center your breath, and begin to let your thoughts slow down. Turn your awareness inward.
<br>Spread your knees wide apart while keeping your big toes touching. Rest your buttocks on your heels.
<br>Those with very tight hips can keep their knees and thighs together.
<br>Sit up straight and lengthen your spine up through the crown of your head.
<br>On an exhalation, bow forward, draping your torso between your thighs. Your heart and chest should rest between or on top of your thighs. Allow your forehead to come to the floor.
<br>Keep your arms long and extended, palms facing down. Press back slightly with your hands to keep your buttocks in contact with your heels. Lengthen from your hips to your armpits, and then extend even further through your fingertips.
<br>For deeper relaxation, bring your arms back to rest alongside your thighs with your palms facing up. Completely relax your elbows.
<br>Let your upper back broaden. Soften and relax your lower back. Allow all tension in your shoulders, arms, and neck to drain away.
<br>Keep your gaze drawn inward with your eyes closed.
<br>Hold for up to a minute or longer, breathing softly.
<br>To release the pose, gently use your hands to walk your torso upright to sit back on your heels.
