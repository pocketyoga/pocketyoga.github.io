		<h2><b>Legs up the wall Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>The pose described here is a passive, supported variation of the Shoulderstand-like Viparita Karani. For your support you'll need one or two thickly folded blankets or a firm round bolster. You'll also need to rest your legs vertically (or nearly so) on a wall or other upright support.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Many teachers maintain that Viparita Karani is an inversion, and as such should be avoided during menstruation. Others though recommend the pose even during menstruation. Check with your teacher before performing this pose during menstruation. As with any inversion Viparita Karani should be avoided if you have serious eye problems, such as glaucoma. With serious neck or back problems only perform this pose with the supervision of an experienced teacher. If your feet begin to tingle during this pose, bend your knees, touch your soles together, and slide the outer edges of your feet down the wall, bringing your heels close to your pelvis.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Sit sideways with your right side against the wall.
<br>Exhale and gently swing your legs up onto the wall and your shoulders and head lightly down onto the floor.
<br>Coming into this pose may take some practice. Your sitz bones don't need to be right against the wall, depending on the tightness of your hamstrings. Experiment with the position until you find the placement that works for you.
