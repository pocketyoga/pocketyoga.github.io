		<h2><b>Happy Baby Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Happy Baby (Ananda Balasana) is an easy exercise often done in Pilates and yoga classes. It is a gentle stretch for the hamstrings, inner thigh, and inner groin, a relaxation exercise for the back, and it also opens up the hips, shoulders, and chest. Happy Baby is a nice treat to give yourself any time. It feels especially relaxing after a workout.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Lie on your back and find a neutral spine position where the natural curves of your spine are present but not exaggerated.
<br>Bring your knees toward your chest. As you bring your knees up, keep your hip sockets soft so that your legs come up but your hips stay down. Keep your neutral spine with your tailbone on the mat.
<br>Flex your feet and show the soles of your feet to the ceiling.
<br>Wrap your first two fingers around your big toes and pull lightly down. Your feet stay flat to the ceiling but your hips release allowing your knees to come closer to your chest as you relax. You can also bring your hands up to the outside of the foot and grasp the foot around the arch.
<br>Take your time and breathe deeply. Enjoy the easy stretch in your hamstrings.
<br>Let your back relax into the floorâ€”don't push it down, just allow it to release naturally. Be a happy baby.
