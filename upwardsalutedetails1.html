		<h2><b>Upward Salute Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>For many people, Upward Salute — Urdhva Hastasana (OORD-vah hahs-TAHS-uh-nuh) — is a natural way to stretch the whole body, often done automatically after sleeping or sitting for long periods. Standing up and reaching the arms overhead awakens the body from toes to fingertips, providing a boost of energy. It’s a simple way to feel rejuvenated!</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Those with shoulder or neck injuries should avoid fully raising their arms overhead. Instead, practice Mountain Pose or a gentler arm variation (see "Modifications & Variations" below). Also, never turn your gaze upwards if it hurts your neck or if you become lightheaded or dizzy (in step 10). Instead, continue to gaze forward at the horizon. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin in Tadasana, standing with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Press your weight evenly across the balls and arches of your feet. If you have trouble balancing, stand with your feet six inches apart (or wider).
<br>Draw down through your heels and straighten your legs. Press down across all four corners of both feet. Then, lift your ankles and the arches of your feet. Squeeze your outer shins toward each other.
<br>Engage your quadriceps, drawing the tops of your thighs up and back. Rotate your thighs slightly inward, widening your sit bones.
<br>Tuck your tailbone slightly, without rounding your lower back. Bring your pelvis to its neutral position and keep your hips even with the center line of your body. Slightly draw your belly in.
<br>Broaden across your collarbones. Elongate your neck. Release your shoulder blades away from your head and toward the back of your waist.
<br>Your ears, shoulders, hips, and ankles should all be in one line. Turn your arms so your palms face forward, fingers reaching toward the floor. This is Tadasana.
<br>As you inhale, sweep your arms out to the side and then up overhead, turning your arms so your palms face each other, fingertips reaching toward the ceiling. Straighten your arms completely, but do not lock the elbow joints.
<br>If your shoulders are tight, keep your arms as wide as your shoulders (or even wider). If you can keep your arms straight without drawing your shoulders up, press your palms together.
<br>Soften the tops of your shoulders away from your ears. Relax your shoulder blades down your back, toward your waist. Draw your lower, front ribs in — do not let these ribs push forward. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor. Keep your collarbones wide.
<br>Tilt your head back gently and gaze up at your thumbs.
<br>Maintain the alignment of Tadasana: Ears, shoulders, hips, and ankles in one line.
<br>Breathe smoothly and deeply. Imagine your breath is moving across the entire length of your body. Lift up through the sides of your waist as you inhale. Soften your shoulders as you exhale.
<br>Hold the pose for up to one minute. To release, exhale and sweep the arms back down to the sides of the body. If you are performing a Sun Salutation, fold at the hips and come directly into Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana).
