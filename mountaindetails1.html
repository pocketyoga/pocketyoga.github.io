		<h2><b>Mountain Pose in Yoga<b></h2>
<p>Mountain Pose (Tadasana) is a foundational yoga pose for all standing poses. You will be using this pose often to prepare for other poses, but it also can be done by itself to help you improve your posture.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p>
	Mountain is a generally safe pose unless you are feeling dizzy or lightheaded. If you are pregnant, you may need a wider stance to feel stable.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Lift up all of your toes and fan them out, then drop them back down to create a wide, solid base. You can separate your heels slightly if your ankles are knocking together uncomfortably.
<br>Let your feet and calves root down into the floor.
<br>Engage your quadriceps (the muscles on the front of your thighs) and draw them upward, causing your kneecaps to rise.
<br>Rotate both thighs inward, creating a widening of the sit bones.
<br>Maintain the natural curves of your spine.
<br>Tone your belly, drawing it in slightly.
<br>Widen your collarbones and check that your shoulders are stacked over your pelvis.
<br>Shrug your shoulders up to your ears and then roll them back to release your shoulder blades down your back. 
<br>Let your arms hang naturally with the elbows slightly bent and the palms facing forward.
<br>Your neck is long, your chin is neither tucked down nor lifted up, and the crown of your head rises toward the ceiling.
<br>Once you have checked all your alignment points, take 5 to 10 breaths while you hold yourself in this position.
