		<h2><b>Forward Fold Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>Standing Forward Fold — Uttanasana (ooh-tuhn-AHS-uh-nuh) — calms the mind while stretching and rejuvenating the whole body. This pose is an essential element of Sun Salutations and helps to prepare the body for deeper forward bends.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
    Uttanasana requires patience and practice to be performed at its fullest expression. It can take years or even decades to reach the deepest variation of the pose, and it is very easy to injure yourself if you push your body to attain it too soon. If you do not have the flexibility to do the pose in proper alignment, practice with a block or with your knees bent until you can straighten your legs without over-rounding your back.
Those with back injuries should practice this pose with bent knees, or only perform Half Standing Forward Fold (Ardha Uttanasana). Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><!--enter details here-->
Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana), with your hands on your hips.
<br>Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lengthening the front of your torso.
<br>Bend your elbows and hold on to each elbow with the opposite hand. Let the crown of your head hang down. Press your heels into the floor as you lift your sit bones toward the ceiling. Turn the tops of your thighs slightly inward. Do not lock your knees.
<br>If you can keep the front of your torso long and your knees straight, place your palms or fingertips on the floor beside your feet. Bring your fingertips in line with your toes and press your palms on the mat. Those with more flexibility can place their palms on the backs of their ankles.
<br>Engage your quadriceps (the front thigh muscles) and draw them up toward the ceiling. The more you engage your quadriceps, the more your hamstrings (the rear thigh muscles) will release.
<br>Bring your weight to the balls of your feet. Keep your hips aligned over your ankles.
<br>Slightly lift and lengthen your torso with each inhalation. Release deeper into the pose with each exhalation. Let your head hang.
<br>Hold the pose for up to one minute. To release, place your hands on your hips. Draw down through your tailbone and keep your back flat as you inhale and return to Tadasana. Repeat 5-10 times. Those practicing Sun Salutations should move directly from Uttanasana into Half Standing Forward Fold (Ardha Uttanasana).
