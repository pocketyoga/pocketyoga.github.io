		<h2><b>Warrior Pose in Yoga<b></h2> <!--enter details here-->
<p>This pose strengthens the arms, shoulders, thighs and back muscles, all in one go. This pose is named after Veerabhadra, a fierce warrior, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The story of the warrior Veerabhadra, as all stories from Upanishads, has a moral that adds value to our life.</p>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <p><!--enter details here-->
   Do not practice the full version of the pose if you are experiencing high blood pressure or heart problems. Those with neck injuries should keep their heads in a neutral position (in step 8) â€” do not look up at the hands. Those with shoulder injuries should keep their raised arms parallel to each other or even wider (in step 7). Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.
